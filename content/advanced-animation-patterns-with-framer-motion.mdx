I got **✨a lot✨** of positive feedback from my [Guide to creating animations that spark joy with Framer Motion](/posts/guide-animations-spark-joy-framer-motion/), and it's undeniable that this library has piqued many developers' interests in the world of web-based animations.

While I introduced in this previous post many of the foundational pieces that compose an animation, and how one can orchestrate multiple transitions very easily with Framer Motion, **I did not touch upon many of the more advanced features that this library provides**.

Ever wondered how to propagate animations throughout several components or to orchestrate complex layout transitions? Well, this article will tell you all about these advanced patterns and show you some of the great things one can accomplish with Framer Motion!
